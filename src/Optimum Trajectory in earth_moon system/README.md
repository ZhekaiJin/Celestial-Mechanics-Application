* Justification of RK4(error drop)  -Scott Jin 

## This part is the souce code for the animation part 

* Document can be viewed here : https://github.com/ZhekaiJin/Celestial-Mechanics-Application/tree/master/src/Animation%20part

P.S RK4 accuracy is proved here with a drop of magnitude of h will lead to a drop of 16 in error
