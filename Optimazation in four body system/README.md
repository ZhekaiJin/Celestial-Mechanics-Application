## This part is for four body optimatzation which generally follow the paper we followed for our project 

https://github.com/ZhekaiJin/Celestial-Mechanics-Application/blob/master/Cited%20Paper.pdf

* firstly a real-time-accuracy sun earth and moon Euclidian space animation was made-->E-S-M rotation.py

* And a easier version was made by generalize all the coefficients for speed and angular momentum.-->earth sun moon rotation in xz plane

* The spaceship trajectory can be easily added into teh program by a transformation frame formula for x and y 

* A trajectory capture program was then made facing real challenge: with three coefficients of motions have to be matched at the boundary.

* The capture result is coarsely shown here with further explanation in the project Document
