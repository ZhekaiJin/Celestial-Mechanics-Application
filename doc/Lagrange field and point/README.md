# Lagrange filed and point

**Contributer**: Scott Jin

**Three-body-problem**: step 1 

## This part is for plotting the Lagrange potential and find the Lagrange points 

* Firstly, the Lagrange point of the earth and moon system need to be found. The Lagrange point is position where the gradational pulls of the two bodies, earth and moon in this case, together to give the centripetal force that the third body needs:

* Animation for Lagrange point 1 in normalized earth and moon frame:

* Then, the gravitational potential field of the earth and moon is computed which gives both the Lagrange points and the general idea of the ideal trajectory.

* Lagrange points is found by the golden search method bulit-in by python package to find all the maximas.
