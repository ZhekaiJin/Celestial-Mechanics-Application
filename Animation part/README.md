# Animation part

## This part is for the animation making for the Fuel free trajectory 

* The main method used is funcanimation taking from teh matploblib package in python 

* The animation is made with the standard RK4 as well as the adaptive RK4, which is generally the same 

* The trajectory, with a specfic starting point, is then found using Legendre transformation and Euler-Lagrange equations to give a low-energy path way. 

* Animation: Using three-body model with a conservation of energy

* The Energy change is concluded to be within 1E-5 J and trajectory is concluded to be around the lagrange points and has a specfic shape as follow:
