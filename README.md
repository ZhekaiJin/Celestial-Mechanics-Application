# Celestial-Mechanics-Application
Physics simulation deploying three-body model and four-body model to achieve a fuel-efficient spaceship trajectory

After three body problem, we extend to the problem to include the sun's effect on the spaceship, too. But we are still focus on the earth and moon rotating frame.

Four Body Probelm:

Animation including the sun:

The energy conservation is held.

And the final trajectory is like this:
