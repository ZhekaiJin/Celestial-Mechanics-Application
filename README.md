Physics simulation deploying three-body model and four-body model to achieve a fuel-efficient spaceship trajectory

Firstly, the three-body system is constructed with earth, moon and a spaceship as example. The trajectory of spaceship around earth is designed to maximize the utilization of gravitational pulls of earth and moon to keep the change in the gravitational energy of the third body (the spaceship) to a minimum.

Firstly, the Lagrange point of the earth and moon system need to be found. The Lagrange point is position where the gradational pulls of the two bodies, earth and moon in this case, together to give the centripetal force that the third body needs:

The energy conservation is held.

And the final trajectory is like this:
